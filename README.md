# R-statistic Courses in Residential College in UM

## Description

This project aims to course materials that I (Runquan Yu) had the reference and created while serving as an R language course instructor during my residency at the college at the University of Macau. The time period covered is from February 20th, 2021 to May 2nd, 2023.

R is a widely used and robust tool that offers many benefits. The ability to perform statistical analyses and generate visually compelling plots is highly desirable and can be valuable in various settings beyond academia, including government or private companies. Regardless of your career path after graduation, possessing these skills can be advantageous (Oh, 2023).

You can find the scripts and reading materials used in this sample materials. Please don't hesitate to create issues or contact [Runquan Yu](https://github.com/YURUNQUAN) (SC02303@um.edu.mo or e1119091@u.nus.edu) if you have any questions about the codes.
